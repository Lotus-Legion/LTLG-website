# LTLG website

This is the public repository for the Lotus Legion website.

Currently, the plan is to build the website with Vue.js 3 and Bootstrap 5.
GitHub Actions will be used to automatically build the project on push to main, the resulting dist folder will be pushed to a separate "deployment" branch where the project will be served with GitHub pages.
